## üöÄ Featured Projects

### üåæ Drought Impact Analysis ([View Project](/drought-economy))
**Objective:** Quantify relationships between U.S. droughts, agricultural employment, and food prices  
**Techniques:**  
- Multivariate analysis (PCA, Cluster Analysis)  
- Time-series outlier detection (Mahalanobis distance)  
- Correlation matrix visualization  
**Key Insight:** 76.9% variance explained via 3 principal components showing drought severity inversely correlates with subsidies  

### üè• Emergency Room Simulation ([View Project](/Emergency-Room-Simulation-))
**Objective:** Optimize ER resource allocation using discrete-event simulation  
**Techniques:**  
- Gamma distribution fitting (shape=0.964, rate=0.064)  
- Simmer package for patient flow modeling  
- Doctor utilization analysis (100% ‚Üí 60% with staffing changes)  
**Impact:** Reduced patient flow time by 57% in optimized model  

### ‚Çø Bitcoin-Stock Correlation ([View Project](/finance))
**Objective:** Analyze Bitcoin's relationship with S&P 500 and tech stocks (2011-2021)  
**Techniques:**  
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests for stationarity  
- Linear regression with differenced variables  
- Trend/seasonality controls  
**Finding:** 1% S&P 500 increase ‚Üí 3.1-8.9% Bitcoin price rise (p<0.01)
